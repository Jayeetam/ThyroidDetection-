# ThyroidDetection-

## Problem Statement:
To build a classification methodology to predict the type of thyroid based on the given training data. 

## Benefits: 
The person can be suffering from thyroid or cannot be and if it is a thyroid positive case then what type of case it is or what type of thyroid it is, model will predict that. This model can be used by hospitals or any organization based on healthcare industry. This model can be used for first level of scrutinize that the person is suffering from thyroid or not, it is hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. If thyroid is found to be positive by this model then treatment can be a little faster. If the result is negative then the reports can be sent to the junior doctors. Then those junior doctors by using their own expertise they will identify that whether the model has done correct prediction or not. Mostly model does correct prediction but we cannot remove the human intervention. If junior doctor finds that the model has done the correct prediction and the patient is not suffering from thyroid then he can release the patient. But again based on the reading and different tests doctor can conclude that the patient is suffering from thyroid and he can treat the patient with proper medication. This is how the mechanism works.
